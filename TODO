	The handlers for CheeseTracker format (both loading and saving)
	use an insidious monstrosity called a "dynamic data structure",
	whose sole purpose is to completely bypass the C++ type
	system. This is just evil.

	CheeseTracker will eventually begin loading its samples with
	libaudiofile, which will increase the number of supported
	sample formats.

	CheeseTracker will eventually support both OGG and FLAC formats,
	both as sample types, and as song output formats.

Here's the TODO list from the ChangeLog:

Since the code has changed hands, so have the plans. Here they are:

- A return to per-channel effect buffers, instead of the "two kinds
  of channels" system that is currently implemented.
- Implementation of the above will enable the effect buffers to be
  controllable from the pattern editor, just as the old-fashioned
  DOS-era effects are. The control column will widen to accommodate
  all the parameters of all the effects in use on a channel. Tooltips
  will assist in associating a control column in the Pattern Editor
  with the corresponding effect parameter in the Buffer screen.
- Fix all the really obvious bugs
- Support for samples with greater than 16-bit precision
- Support for simultaneous output to multiple, multi-channel sound devices.
- Proper error handling
- WAV and OGG exporting

No longer planned for 1.0.0: Porting to Windows or Mac OS.
